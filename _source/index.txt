HABS Forecast Model's Documentation
===============================================
The HABS nowcast and forecast model uses satellite and modeled environmental data to forecast the probability of a harmful algal bloom event along the west coast the the US. This documentation covers the coding for the CoastWatch portion of the project, which covers the following steps: 

* downloading NASA MODIS L2 data;
* extracting chlorophyll a, rf488 nm, and rf555 nm bands;
* gridding the data binning them into daily composite;
* compiling 180 days of data for each band and filling in missing data with DINEOF;
* downsampling the data to the ROMS model resolution and writing to a netCDF4 file.
